# git_scripts
If you use a main folder for most of your used git repositorities on you local machine, this small utility can help you to update and maintain your repositories. 

If



''' ./git_pull_all.sh ''' goes into all available folders, checks if theses are git repositories and does a '''git pull''' command. 

''' ./git_status.sh ''' checks the current status of all repositories by executing the '''git status''' command.
